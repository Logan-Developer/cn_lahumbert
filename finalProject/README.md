# Final project: A Cloud Storage solution that uses NodeJS and React 

## Get dependances
In order to run the app for the first time you need to install npm and NodeJS.

Then, go to the backend folder, and run the following command:
```bash
npm i
```
Then do the same in the frontend folder.
These will install all the libraries you need to run the app.

## Usage
After installing the required dependances, you can go to the backend folder and run the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
In a seperate terminal, you can do the same in the frontend folder.
In the terminal in which the frontend is running, you can see which address and port are used.
Type it in a web browser to access the web client of the app.
