# Small C program that lets a server and a client communicate using TCP sockets

## How to build
```bash
make
```

## Usage
### Server
```bash
./server.out <port>
```

### Client
```bash
./client.out <port> <mode>
```

- '1': Echo mode. The client sends a message to the server and the server sends it back.
- '2': File transfer mode. The server sends a file to the client.
